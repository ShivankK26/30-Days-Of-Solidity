# About The Project






In this GitHub Repository, I've created a wide variety of Smart Contracts in order to Educate and Empower folks about Web3 Development. All these Contracts range from Basic to extremely Advanced Level. I have also added Smart Contracts like creating your own ERC20 Token, Creating your own Smart Wallet, NFTs Contracts, and much more. So, just read and enjoy them!! 


Use the `README.md` to get started.
